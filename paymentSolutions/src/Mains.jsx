                        that’s if there’s anything like that. I love the perfect blend 
                        that makes you up as a woman, my woman. Just like the first time we met, you still successfully make my heart race and send signals to my brain. 
                        I love that I am spending the rest of my life with you, that’s the fulfillment of an age-long dream I’ve had since we met. You have created beautiful times and experiences for us, and I am just glad that my life is with yours every day. I love you so much, darling, you’re my baby girl no matter how old we grow together.”

                        7. “He that finds a wife has found a good thing, but I think it should be “He that finds a good woman has found heaven” because that’s what you make me feel. My life is blessed to have you.
                         My home is blessed to have you in it. With each new day, I love you more than the previous days. You compliment me and bring out the best that I’ve got to offer. Having you close to me is the best feeling ever. It will cost me nothing to promise you that I will love you forever and ever because you’re deserving of that and 
                        more. With you in my arms and in my heart, there’s nothing in the world that I cannot face. And I will do just anything for you. That’s the extent of my love for you, every day.”
